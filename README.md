## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset was provided by Airbnb, a vacation online rental comapany where locals can provide accomodation to tourists and travellers for a set price. Our data is a set of all the different rentals that took place before the 17th of December 2020 in Dublin, Ireland, along with information like the neighbourhood, the type of room, the host name, and the price. This data was published by Airbnb as a way for them to be transparent with the general public, as well as public interest to compare tourism trends in different cities. Finally, this data was collected through digital means, compiling all of Airbnb's historical bookings in Dublin Ireland into one dataset.
