## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

*As more and more people want to travel and explore new places around the world, tourism is fast gaining popularity and has consequently led to overcrowding in many major tourist destinations. Airbnbs have helped in reducing the overcrowding in hotels by providing equally promising accommodation options at lower costs. They have also contributed to the local income, thus improving the economy and increasing tourism prospects. By analyzing our dataset, we can identify trends about the most popular locations to stay in, the types of accommodation preferred, and the most rated Bnbs. The company can use this information to improve its services and make more informed decisions regarding future developments. Finally, we could use the results from our analysis throughout the course of this project to build a user facing Dashboard that would analyse, contain key metrics and data points, as well as display key performance indicators (KPI), specific to Airbnb.*

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset was provided by Airbnb, a vacation online rental company where locals can provide accomodation to tourists and travellers for a set price. Our data is a set of all the different rentals that took place in Cape Town, along with information like the neighbourhood, the type of room, the host name, and the price. The dataset also provides the exact geographical location of the bookings, with both the longitude and the latitude specified. Our dataset has some limitations, however, and while it contains a column for "number_of_reviews", it does not contain what exactly the reviews were like, whether they were positive (5 stars) or negative (1 star). The dataset has 19278 rows and 16 variables (columns). This data was published by Airbnb as a way for them to be transparent with the general public, as well as public interest to compare tourism trends in different cities. Airbnb states that the data has been "analyzed, cleansed and aggregated" and that the publishing of the data is to "faciliate public discussion". Finally, this data was collected through digital means, compiling all of Airbnb's historical bookings in Cape Town into one dataset.
