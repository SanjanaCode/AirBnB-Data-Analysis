## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

As more and more people want to travel and explore new places around the world, tourism is fast gaining popularity and has consequently led to overcrowding in many major tourist destinations. Airbnbs have helped in reducing the overcrowding in hotels by providing equally promising accommodation options at lower costs. They have also contributed to the local income, thus improving the economy and increasing tourism prospects. By analyzing our dataset, we can identify trends about the most popular locations to stay, the types of accommodation preferred, and the most rated Bnbs. The company can use this information to improve its services and make more informed decisions regarding future developments.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset was provided by Airbnb, a vacation online rental company where locals can provide accomodation to tourists and travellers for a set price. Our data is a set of all the different rentals that took place before the 17th of December 2020 in Dublin, Ireland, along with information like the neighbourhood, the type of room, the host name, and the price. The dataset also provides the exact geographical location of the bookings, with both the longitude and the latitude specified. It has 7895 rows and 16 variables (columns). This data was published by Airbnb as a way for them to be transparent with the general public, as well as public interest to compare tourism trends in different cities. Airbnb states that the data has been "analyzed, cleansed and aggregated" and that the publishing of the data is to "faciliate public discussion". Finally, this data was collected through digital means, compiling all of Airbnb's historical bookings in Dublin, Ireland into one dataset.
