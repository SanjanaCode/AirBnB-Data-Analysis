Airbnbs have helped in reducing the overcrowding in hotels by providing equally promising accommodation options at lower costs. By analyzing our dataset, we can identify trends about the most popular locations to stay in, the types of accommodation preferred, and the most rated Bnbs. </run>

The dataset also provides the exact geographical location of the bookings, with both the longitude and the latitude specified.The dataset has 19278 rows and 16 variables (columns).The aim of this analysis is to speculate how room type and all the other factors depend on each other. By observing potential trends or relationships between these variables we aim to understand how room types depend on factors like locality, price, availability, and number of reviews affect it.</run>

Airbnbs have helped in reducing the overcrowding in hotels by providing equally promising accommodation options at lower costs. By analyzing our dataset, we can identify trends about the most popular locations to stay in, the types of accommodation preferred, and the most rated Bnbs. </run>

This is indicative of the general trend of house prices being more expensive closer to the city centre therefore the hosts charge a higher price.</run>
